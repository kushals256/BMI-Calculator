# **BMI Calculator**

This project is a user-friendly **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** built with **Streamlit**, a Python-based web application framework. The calculator allows users to input their weight and height in different units and calculates their BMI, providing instant feedback on their health status.

---

## **Features**
- **Weight Input**: Enter your weight in kilograms.
- **Height Input Options**: 
  - Centimeters
  - Meters
  - Feet
- **Real-Time BMI Calculation**: The BMI is calculated as soon as the required inputs are provided, using the formula:
  \[
  BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
  \]
- **Health Feedback**: Based on the calculated BMI, the app provides feedback in the following categories:
  - Extremely Underweight
  - Underweight
  - Healthy
  - Overweight
  - Extremely Overweight
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops and mobile browsers.

## **Health Status Classification**
The app categorizes your BMI as follows:
| **BMI Range**       | **Health Status**         |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Less than 16         | Extremely Underweight     |
| 16 - 18.5            | Underweight              |
| 18.5 - 25            | Healthy                  |
| 25 - 30             | Overweight               |
| Greater than 30      | Extremely Overweight     |

## **Technologies Used**
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Python**: Core programming language for BMI calculations and logic.
